# Forecasting-Stock-Price

In this project, I employed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time series forecasting of Reliance Industries' stock prices. LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network, was used to capture the temporal dependencies and trends in stock price data. The model was trained on historical stock prices to predict future price movements with a high degree of accuracy. This project highlighted the potential of LSTM networks in financial forecasting and provided valuable insights for investment strategies. It showcases the application of deep learning in predicting stock market trends.
